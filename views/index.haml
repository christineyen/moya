%h1 ReadItLater -> Instapaper migrations
%p Enter your RIL and Instapaper credentials below to export your pending RIL bookmarks and import them into Instapaper. If you're not comfortable with pasting in your credentials, I recommend you go change your passwords to something temporary, until RIL / Instapaper support OAuth :)
%form{ :class => 'credentials', :action => 'migrate', :method => 'post' }
  #readitlater.column
    .column-header ReadItLater credentials
    %ul
      %li
        %label{ :for => 'ril_username' } Username
        %input{ :id => 'ril_username' }
      %li
        %label{ :for => 'ril_password' } Password
        %input{ :id => 'ril_password' }
  #instapaper.column
    .column-header Instapaper credentials
    %ul
      %li
        %label{ :for => 'inst_username' } Username
        %input{ :id => 'inst_username' }
      %li
        %label{ :for => 'inst_password' } Password
        %input{ :id => 'inst_password' }
  #submit
    %input{ :type => 'submit', :value => 'Begin migration!' }
%p{ :class => 'details' } I was a reasonably satisfied ReadItLater user for awhile (if I recall, the main tipping point in my decision between the two services in the first place was the ever-so-slightly superior RIL iPhone app, which supported real full-screen support for articles).
