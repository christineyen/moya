%h1 ReadItLater -> Instapaper migrations
%p Enter your RIL and Instapaper credentials below to export your pending RIL bookmarks and import them into Instapaper. If you're not comfortable with pasting in your credentials, I recommend you go change your passwords to something temporary, until RIL / Instapaper support OAuth :)
%p Nothing you enter will be saved - everything should simply pass straight through our service and add items to your Instapaper account. Note that this'll take a long time if you've got lots of items in RIL, so please be patient!

%p{ :class => 'details' } I was a reasonably satisfied ReadItLater user for awhile (if I recall, the main tipping point in my decision between the two services in the first place was the ever-so-slightly superior RIL iPhone app, which supported real full-screen support for articles).
